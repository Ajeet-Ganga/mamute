I work with Java all day long. The most used idiom (code snippet) I'm programming in Java, is to test if an `object != null` before I use it. This is to avoid a [NullPointerException][1]. I find the code very ugly and it becomes unreadable.

Is there a good alternative to avoid this code snippet? 

**Update:**
Pan, I was not clear with my question. I want to address the necessity to test every object if you want to access a field or method of this object. For example:

    ...
    if (someobject != null)
    {
        someobject.doCalc();
    }
    ...

in this case I want avoid a `NullPointerException`, and I don't know exactly if the object is `null` or not. So my code get splattered with these tests.

Nevertheless thanks a lot for your answers, I got a bunch of new insight.
