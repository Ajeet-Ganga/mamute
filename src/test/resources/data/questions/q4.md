I was looking at the new APIs introduced in [Android 4.2][1]. While looking at the [`UserManager`][4] class I came across the following method:

>  public boolean isUserAGoat ()
> 
>  Used to determine whether the user making this call is subject to
> teleportations.
> 
>  Returns whether the user making this call is a goat.

How and when should this be used?
