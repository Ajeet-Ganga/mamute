I'm currently using the following to generate an 8 character pseudo random upper case string [A-Z]

    value = ""; 8.times{value  << (65 + rand(25)).chr}

but it looks junky, and since it isn't a single statement it can't be passed as an argument. To get a mixed case string [a-zA-Z] I further hack into it with

    value = ""; 8.times{value << ((rand(2)==1?65:97) + rand(25)).chr}

Just looks like trash. Anyone have a better method?
