It's a time zone change on December 31st in Shanghai.

See [this page][1] for details of 1927 in Shanghai. Basically at midnight at the end of 1927, the clocks went back 5 minutes and 52 seconds. So "1927-12-31 23:54:08" actually happened twice, and it looks like Java is parsing it as the *later* possible instant for that local date/time - hence the difference.

Just another episode in the often weird and wonderful world of time zones.
