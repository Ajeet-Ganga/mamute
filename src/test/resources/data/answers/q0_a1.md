You've encountered a [local time discontinuity][1]:

> When local standard time was about to reach Sunday, 1. January 1928,
> 00:00:00 clocks were turned backward 0:05:52 hours to Saturday, 31.
> December 1927, 23:54:08 local standard time instead

This is not particularly strange and has happened pretty much everywhere at one time or another as timezones were switched or changed due to political or administrative actions.
