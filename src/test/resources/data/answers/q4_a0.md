From their **[source][1]**, it looks like the method returns `false` all the time:

    /**
     * Used to determine whether the user making this call is subject to
     * teleportations.
     * @return whether the user making this call is a goat 
     */
    public boolean isUserAGoat() {
        return false;
    }

It looks like the method has no real use for us as developers. Someone has previously stated that it might be an **[Easter egg][2]**.
