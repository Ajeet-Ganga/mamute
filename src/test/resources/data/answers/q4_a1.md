This appears to be an inside joke at Google. It's also featured in the Google Chrome task manager. It has no purpose, other than some engineers finding it amusing. Which is a purpose by itself, if you will.

1. In Chrome, open the Task Manager with <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Esc</kbd>. 
2. Right click to add the  `Goats Teleported` column.
3. Wonder.

There is even a huge Chromium bug report about [too many teleported goats][1].

![chrome][2]  

The following Chromium [source code snippet][3] is stolen from the [HN][4] comments.


    int TaskManagerModel::GetGoatsTeleported(int index) const {
      int seed = goat_salt_ * (index + 1);
      return (seed >> 16) & 255;
    }
